    "He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,",
    "\"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\"",
    "An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.",
    "And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.",
    "When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.",
    "\"Why are you sleeping?\" he asked them. \"Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.\"",

    "Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, \"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?",
    "Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns.\"",
    "Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.",
    "But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.",

    "\"If you are the Christ,\" they said, \"tell us.\" Jesus answered, \"If I tell you, you will not believe me,",
    "and if I asked you, you would not answer.",

    "Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.",

    "So Pilate asked Jesus, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied.",
    "Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, \"I find no basis for a charge against this man.\"",

    "When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.",
    "He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.",

    "For the third time he spoke to them: \"Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.\"",

    "So Pilate decided to grant their demand.",

    "As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.",
    "A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.",
    "Jesus turned and said to them, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.",
    "For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'",

    "The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, \"He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.\"",
    "The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar",

    "One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \"Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!\"",
    "But the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God,\" he said, \"since you are under the same sentence?",
    "We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\"",

    "\"What things?\" he asked. \"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.",

    "but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.",
    "Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\"",
    "He said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!",
