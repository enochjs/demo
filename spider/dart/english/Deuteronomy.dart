    "These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the desert east of the Jordan--that is, in the Arabah--opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.",
    "(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)",
    "In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them.",
    "This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.",
    "East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:",
    "The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, \"You have stayed long enough at this mountain.",
    "Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.",
    "See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore he would give to your fathers--to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--and to their descendants after them.\"",
    "At that time I said to you, \"You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.",
    "The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.",
    "May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!",
    "But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?",
    "Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.\"",
    "You answered me, \"What you propose to do is good.\"",
    "So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you--as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.",
    "And I charged your judges at that time: Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly, whether the case is between brother Israelites or between one of them and an alien.",
    "Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of any man, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.",
    "And at that time I told you everything you were to do.",
    "Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.",
    "Then I said to you, \"You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.",
    "See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.\"",
    "Then all of you came to me and said, \"Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.\"",
    "The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.",
    "They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.",
    "Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, \"It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.\"",

    "Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart. They say, 'The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.'\"",
    "Then I said to you, \"Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.",
    "The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,",
    "and in the desert. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.\"",
    "In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,",

    "\"Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers,",

    "So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD'S command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.",
    "The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.",
    "You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.",

    "Give the people these orders: 'You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.",
    "Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.",

    "The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.",
    "So we went on past our brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.",
    "Then the LORD said to me, \"Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.\"",

    "And the LORD said, \"Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.\" So we crossed the valley.",
    "Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.",
    "The LORD'S hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.",
    "Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,",

    "\"Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.",
    "When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.\"",

    "Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot--",
    "as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us--until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us.\"",
    "But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.",
    "The LORD said to me, \"See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.\"",
    "When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,",
    "the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.",
    "At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them--men, women and children. We left no survivors.",
    "But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.",
    "From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.",

  "Deuteronomy-2": [
    "Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.",
    "The LORD said to me, \"Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.\"",
    "So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.",
    "At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them--the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan.",
    "All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.",
    "We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying every city--men, women and children.",

    "We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan.",
    "(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)",

    "The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.",

    "And I gave Gilead to Makir.",
    "But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.",
    "Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.",

    "Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants.",
    "I will proclaim the name of the LORD. Oh, praise the greatness of our God!",
    "He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.",
    "They have acted corruptly toward him; to their shame they are no longer his children, but a warped and crooked generation.",
    "Is this the way you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you?",
    "Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you.",
    "When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.",
    "For the LORD'S portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance.",
    "In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye,",
    "like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions.",
    "The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him.",
    "He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag,",
    "with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape.",
    "Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled with food, he became heavy and sleek. He abandoned the God who made him and rejected the Rock his Savior.",
    "They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols.",
    "They sacrificed to demons, which are not God--gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your fathers did not fear.",
    "You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.",
    "The LORD saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters.",
    "\"I will hide my face from them,\" he said, \"and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful.",
    "They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.",
    "For a fire has been kindled by my wrath, one that burns to the realm of death below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains.",
    "\"I will heap calamities upon them and spend my arrows against them.",
    "I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.",
    "In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. Young men and young women will perish, infants and gray-haired men.",
    "I said I would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind,",
    "but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the LORD has not done all this.'\"",
    "They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them.",
    "If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be!",
    "How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?",
    "For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede.",
    "Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness.",
    "Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.",
    "\"Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults?",
    "It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them.\"",
    "The LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free.",
    "He will say: \"Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in,",
    "the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up to help you! Let them give you shelter!",
    "\"See now that I myself am He! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand.",
    "I lift my hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,",
    "when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me.",
    "I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.\"",
    "Rejoice, O nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people.",
    "Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.",
    "When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,",
    "he said to them, \"Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.",
    "They are not just idle words for you--they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.\"",
    "On that same day the LORD told Moses,",
    "\"Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession.",
    "There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.",
    "This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.",
    "Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel.\""

  "Deuteronomy-32": [
    "This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.",
    "He said: \"The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes.",
    "Surely it is you who love the people; all the holy ones are in your hand. At your feet they all bow down, and from you receive instruction,",
    "the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob.",
    "He was king over Jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled, along with the tribes of Israel.",
    "\"Let Reuben live and not die, nor his men be few.\"",
    "And this he said about Judah: \"Hear, O LORD, the cry of Judah; bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause. Oh, be his help against his foes!\"",
    "About Levi he said: \"Your Thummim and Urim belong to the man you favored. You tested him at Massah; you contended with him at the waters of Meribah.",
    "He said of his father and mother, 'I have no regard for them.' He did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children, but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant.",
    "He teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel. He offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar.",
    "Bless all his skills, O LORD, and be pleased with the work of his hands. Smite the loins of those who rise up against him; strike his foes till they rise no more.\"",
    "About Benjamin he said: \"Let the beloved of the LORD rest secure in him, for he shields him all day long, and the one the LORD loves rests between his shoulders.\"",
    "About Joseph he said: \"May the LORD bless his land with the precious dew from heaven above and with the deep waters that lie below;",
    "with the best the sun brings forth and the finest the moon can yield;",
    "with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills;",
    "with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.",
    "In majesty he is like a firstborn bull; his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim; such are the thousands of Manasseh.\"",
    "About Zebulun he said: \"Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents.",
    "They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer sacrifices of righteousness; they will feast on the abundance of the seas, on the treasures hidden in the sand.\"",
    "About Gad he said: \"Blessed is he who enlarges Gad's domain! Gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head.",
    "He chose the best land for himself; the leader's portion was kept for him. When the heads of the people assembled, he carried out the LORD'S righteous will, and his judgments concerning Israel.\"",
    "About Dan he said: \"Dan is a lion's cub, springing out of Bashan.\"",
    "About Naphtali he said: \"Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the LORD and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake.\"",
    "About Asher he said: \"Most blessed of sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil.",
    "The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will equal your days.",
    "\"There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty.",
    "The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He will drive out your enemy before you, saying, 'Destroy him!'",
    "So Israel will live in safety alone; Jacob's spring is secure in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens drop dew.",
    "Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will trample down their high places.\""

    "Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land--from Gilead to Dan,",
    "all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,",
    "the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.",
    "Then the LORD said to him, \"This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.\"",
    "And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had said.",
    "He buried him in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.",
    "Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.",
    "The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.",
    "Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses.",
    "Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,",
    "who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt--to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.",
    "For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel."
