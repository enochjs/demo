    "They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,",
    "and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" they said.",
    "They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.",
    "After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.",
    "As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.",
    "They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).",
    "There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.",
    "When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.",
    "And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.",
    "Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
    "Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.",
    "Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads",
    "and saying, \"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\"",
    "In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.",
    "\"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.",
    "He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\"",
    "In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.",
    "From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.",
    "About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"",
    "When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling Elijah.\"",
    "Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.",
    "The rest said, \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\"",
    "And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.",
    "At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.",
    "The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.",
    "They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.",
    "When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\"",
    "Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.",
    "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.",
    "As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.",
    "Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.",
    "Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,",
    "and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.",
    "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.",
    "The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.",
    "\"Sir,\" they said, \"we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'",
    "So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.\"",
    "\"Take a guard,\" Pilate answered. \"Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.\"",
    "So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard."

  "Matthew-27": [
    "After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.",
    "There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.",
    "His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.",
    "The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.",
    "The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.",
    "He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.",
    "Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\"",
    "So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.",
    "Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.",
    "Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\"",
    "While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.",
    "When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,",
    "telling them, \"You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'",
    "If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\"",
    "So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.",
    "Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.",
    "When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.",
    "Then Jesus came to them and said, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.",
    "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,",
    "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\""
