    "I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,",
    "and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,",
    "but each of them had four faces and four wings.",

    "Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.",
    "Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.",
    "Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.",
    "The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.",
    "The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.",
    "As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.",
    "This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.",
    "As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went.",
    "Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.",
    "When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.",
    "Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.",
    "When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.",
    "Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.",
    "Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.",
    "When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.",
    "Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.",
    "Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.",
    "I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.",
    "Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking."

    "the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.",
    "The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me.",
    "I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days--overwhelmed.",

    "\"Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Since you did not warn him, he will die for his sin. The righteous things he did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for his blood.",
    "But if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning, and you will have saved yourself.\"",
    "The hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, \"Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.\"",
    "So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.",
    "Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: \"Go, shut yourself inside your house.",
    "And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.",

    "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"These are the boundaries by which you are to divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel, with two portions for Joseph.",
    "You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your forefathers, this land will become your inheritance.",
    "\"This is to be the boundary of the land: \"On the north side it will run from the Great Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath to Zedad,",

    "The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan, along the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the north boundary.",
    "\"On the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This will be the east boundary.",

    "\"Asher will have one portion; it will border the territory of Dan from east to west.",
    "\"Naphtali will have one portion; it will border the territory of Asher from east to west.",

    "\"Bordering the territory of Judah from east to west will be the portion you are to present as a special gift. It will be 25,000 cubits wide, and its length from east to west will equal one of the tribal portions; the sanctuary will be in the center of it.",
    "\"The special portion you are to offer to the LORD will be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide.",
    "This will be the sacred portion for the priests. It will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the east side and 25,000 cubits long on the south side. In the center of it will be the sanctuary of the LORD.",
    "This will be for the consecrated priests, the Zadokites, who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray.",
    "It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, bordering the territory of the Levites.",
    "\"Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits.",
    "They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands, because it is holy to the LORD.",
    "\"The remaining area, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for the common use of the city, for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it",
    "and will have these measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits.",
    "The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits on the north, 250 cubits on the south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250 cubits on the west.",
    "What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city.",
    "The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel.",
    "The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion, along with the property of the city.",
    "\"What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the city property will belong to the prince. It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them.",
    "So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin.",

    "\"The distance all around will be 18,000 cubits. \"And the name of the city from that time on will be: THE LORD IS THERE.\""
