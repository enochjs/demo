    "The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her.",
    "Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, \"I will be king.\" So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.",

    "Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, \"What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?\"",
    "Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, \"Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.\"",
    "\"Not at all!\" Jonathan answered. \"Our lord King David has made Solomon king.",

    "\"As you know,\" he said, \"the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD.",

    "When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand.",
    "\"I have one small request to make of you,\" she said. \"Do not refuse me.\" The king replied, \"Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.\"",
    "So she said, \"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.\"",
    "King Solomon answered his mother, \"Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him--after all, he is my older brother--yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!\"",
    "Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!",
    "And now, as surely as the LORD lives--he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised--Adonijah shall be put to death today!\"",
    "So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.",
    "To Abiathar the priest the king said, \"Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships.\"",
    "So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.",
    "When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.",
    "King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, \"Go, strike him down!\"",

    "The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them--Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army--were better men and more upright than he.",
    "May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD'S peace forever.\"",
    "So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land in the desert.",
    "The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.",
    "Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.",
    "The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.\"",
    "Shimei answered the king, \"What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.\" And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.",
    "But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, \"Your slaves are in Gath.\"",
    "At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath.",

    "the king summoned Shimei and said to him, \"Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.'",
    "Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?\"",

    "As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, \"Is it really you, my lord Elijah?\"",
    "\"Yes,\" he replied. \"Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'\"",
    "\"What have I done wrong,\" asked Obadiah, \"that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?",
    "As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.",
    "But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.'",
    "I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth.",
    "Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD'S prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.",
    "And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!\"",
    "Elijah said, \"As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.\"",
    "So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.",
    "When he saw Elijah, he said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\"",
    "\"I have not made trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD'S commands and have followed the Baals.",
    "Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\"",
    "So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.",
    "Elijah went before the people and said, \"How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.\" But the people said nothing.",
    "Then Elijah said to them, \"I am the only one of the LORD'S prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.",
    "Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.",
    "Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire--he is God.\" Then all the people said, \"What you say is good.\"",
    "Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.\"",
    "So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. \"O Baal, answer us!\" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.",
    "At noon Elijah began to taunt them. \"Shout louder!\" he said. \"Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.\"",
    "So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.",
    "Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.",
    "Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come here to me.\" They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins.",
    "Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Your name shall be Israel.\"",
    "With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.",
    "He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.\"",
    "\"Do it again,\" he said, and they did it again. \"Do it a third time,\" he ordered, and they did it the third time.",
    "The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.",
    "At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.",
    "Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.\"",
    "Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.",
    "When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, \"The LORD--he is God! The LORD--he is God!\"",
    "Then Elijah commanded them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!\" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.",
    "And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.\"",
    "So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.",
    "\"Go and look toward the sea,\" he told his servant. And he went up and looked. \"There is nothing there,\" he said. Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\"",
    "The seventh time the servant reported, \"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" So Elijah said, \"Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\"",
    "Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.",
    "The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel."

    "Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,",
    "while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. \"I have had enough, LORD,\" he said. \"Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.\"",
    "Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, \"Get up and eat.\"",
    "He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.",
    "The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, \"Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.\"",
    "So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.",
    "There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\"",
    "He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\"",
    "The LORD said, \"Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.\" Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.",
    "After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.",
    "When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\"",
    "He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\"",
    "The LORD said to him, \"Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.",
    "Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.",
    "Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.",
    "Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel--all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him.\"",
    "So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.",
    "Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. \"Let me kiss my father and mother good-by,\" he said, \"and then I will come with you.\" \"Go back,\" Elijah replied. \"What have I done to you?\"",
